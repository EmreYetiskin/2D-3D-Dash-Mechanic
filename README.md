# 2D and 3D Dash Mechanics Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of dash mechanics for 2D and 3D games using Unity. Below is a detailed overview of the features and key components covered in this project.

## Project Features

### 1. **2D Dash Mechanics**
- **Horizontal Dash:** Allows the player to quickly move forward over a set distance.
- **Directional Dash:** Enables dashing in different directions based on player input.
- **Mid-Air Dash:** Supports dashing while the player is airborne.

### 2. **After-Image Effect**
- **Performance Optimization:** Adds a stylish after-image effect using object pooling, ensuring efficient performance while enhancing visual appeal during dashes.

### 3. **3D Dash Mechanics**
- **Force Application:** Adapts dash mechanics for 3D environments with proper force handling.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Ensures smoother dash movements in 3D space for a more fluid player experience.

### 4. **Camera Effects**
- **Dynamic Field of View (FoV):** Implements camera adjustments to dynamically change the field of view during dashes, creating a more immersive visual effect.

## Usage and Experience

This project serves as a reference and example for developers looking to integrate dash mechanics into their 2D or 3D games. You can explore and adapt the provided code to quickly add these mechanics to your own projects.
